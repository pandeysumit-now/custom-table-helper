### Find it frustrating that number field is not read-only by default on new tables?

Every time you create new custom table extending from task, the number field is by default editable. There's almost no-reason at all why this field should not be set to read-only by default! 
Now you can import the attached XML & no more problemo!  It will do following every time you create new custom table extending from task - 
- Sets number field to read-only
- Removes default ITIL reference qualifier from assigned_to and assignment_group and sets only "active=true"
